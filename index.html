                <p> I am Ashenafi SHIFERAW. I was born in Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia. Currently, 
                    I am Berlin based and I am studying Internet of Things (IoT) in action,
                    in ReDI Digital Integration school. Previously, I have studied and practicing 
                    web-development since October 2018. I have a very good knowledge of HTML, 
                    SCC and SASS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVA-SCRIPT, REACT and I also have a good understanding 
                    of backend technologies such as NODE.JS, MongoDB, MYSQL, EXPRESS etc.
                    In my pre-web development experience, I studied Banking and Finance and French language 
                    & communication and pedagogy and hold a Masterâ€™s degree from Rouen 
                    University in France. I have several years of working experience as a French 
                    language teacher and translator in different local and international organizations.

                <p> 
                    I graduated with a Diploma in Banking and Finance from Addis Ababa University School of
                    Commerce in 2004. I continued my education with a Bachelor in French language and
                    communication at Addis Ababa University from which I graduated with distinction in 2009. 
                    Being awarded with a French government funded scholarship, I continued studying Teaching 
                    French as a foreign language. I graduated with a Masters from the University of Rouen in 
                    France in 2011. For several years I worked as French language teacher and translator in 
                    various local and international organizations, including Addis Ababa University, 
                    Alliance-francaise, the African Union and I delivered private & group courses in the German GIZ, 
                    the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Addis etc. And, private contract translation works with UNESCO 
                    and many other organizations.

            <p>
                I joined DCI (Digital Career Institute) in August 2018 to start my web-development education. I have 
                learned and I am still learning a lot on daily basis. I learned and used many programming languages 
                and libraries such as HTML, SCC, SASS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVA-SCRIPT, REACT, NODE.JS, mongoDB, MYSQL, 
                EXPRESS etc. which I used to make websites and small apps. I already practiced a variety of 
                technologies and am highly motivated for and interested in programming. I am therefore looking 
                forward to joining a company and apply what I have already leaned and continue to learn more. 
                I am eager to broaden my knowledge every day and to code amazing apps.

                <p>
                    As a teacher and a translator, I worked in various organizations and with people from different 
                    age groups, educational backgrounds and different nationalities. My intercultural communication 
                    skills and my intercultural sensitivity was a great advantage for this task. Furthermore I 
                    developed and applied my self-confidence in public speech, group-working, brainstorming and 
                    collective problem solving.

                <h2 class="sub-work-p1">Web Related Job Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to learn a lot during my one year stay at DCI and I have already applied much of the coding 
                    technics that I learned. I am learning a lot from different sources and I am always eager to apply 
                    new things. I managed to make different web-sites and various mini apps which could perform various 
                    functions. For my final project, I have participated in a group and we have tried to impliment Internet 
                    of things (IoT) by realizing a home automation project. Once I have finished the project, currently I 
                    have joined ReDI Digital integration school with the aim of learnig IoT more in depth.
                    Furthermore, I am eager to build on my experience and join a motivated and motivating team and 
                    accomplish more nice things together. I invite you to go to the below links in order to visit my deployed
